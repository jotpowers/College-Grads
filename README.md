# Information for Recent College Graduates (which has morphed into "Introduction to Investing")

The information in here started when I had several RCGs that were starting to work for me.  Now, some of it was very specific to the company I was working for, but over time, it because a document that people were referring to for a lot of different things, primarily due to the finance information/opinions in it.

Then it grew to the point where I decided it probably needed to be crowdsourced, but the discussion was how.  And now we have it on Github.  Yes, I'll take pull requests.  

# Overview
I graduated so long ago that the basics of how to incorporate into corporate America are so second nature that I forget about all the questions I had at the time.  So, here are the thoughts that I find myself distilling down for my RCGs when they join the team.

**Note:** These are my opinions.  Other people might have different ones.  Maybe people like you, so make sure you do your own research and, when in doubt, ask someone who does this stuff for a living.
