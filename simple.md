## What To Do

The "Overview" can be overwhelming, so I'm going to try to distill it down into a simple plan of action for you.  That means it won't be very nuanced, but you'll have all of the rest of the content to explore when you feel a little more settled.  I'll link to that more detail if you want to dig in.

## Healthcare

### Medical

If your company offers it, sign up for the PPO.  It has the most flexibility and least complexity when you're starting out.

### Dental

Sign up for the "premium" package.  It is likely only a few dollars more and if you have something more complex you're not worrying about it.  

### Vision

If you or your family needs glasses or contacts, sign up for the basic, otherwise you can probably just decline.  You can change it next year during open enrollment if you learn in the meantime you don't like it.  If you want to get corrective surgery, it's probably better covered by the slightly more expensive upgraded plan.

### Flexible Spending Account

If you don't need glasses or dental work you're aware of, just put ~$100 in to allow you to pay a co-pay or two and maybe for your dental cleanings.

## Retirement

### 401k 
Put as much money as you can in your 401k.  Choose the traditional one so that it's pre-tax money and reduces your tax obligation.

Invest it in the option that is available to you that is closest to VTSAX, which is to say, a total market fund with a very low expense ratio.

## Life Insurance

### Sign up
Sign up for the maximum the company offers that you don't have to do a physical for.  It will be enough in the short term, and that would provide a good amount to your survivors and it tends to be cheap.
